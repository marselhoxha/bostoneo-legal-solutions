                              VERIFIED COMPLAINT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMES NOW, the Plaintiff, Robert Smith, by and through his undersigned counsel, and for his Complaint against the Defendant, TechCorp Industries, Inc., states as follows:

                                   PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Robert Smith ("Plaintiff" or "Mr. Smith") is an individual residing at 123 Main Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02108. Mr. Smith was employed by Defendant as a Senior Software Engineer from March 15, 2019 until his wrongful termination on August 28, 2024.

2. Defendant TechCorp Industries, Inc. ("Defendant" or "TechCorp") is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 750 Technology Drive, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139. TechCorp is engaged in the business of developing enterprise software solutions and employs approximately 450 employees in Massachusetts.

                                 JURISDICTION

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 212, § 3, as the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.

4. Venue is proper in Suffolk County as the Defendant maintains its principal Massachusetts office in Cambridge, which is adjacent to Suffolk County, and significant events giving rise to this action occurred in the greater Boston metropolitan area.

                              FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Employment History and Performance

5. Plaintiff commenced employment with Defendant on March 15, 2019, as a Software Engineer II. Based on his exceptional performance, Plaintiff was promoted to Senior Software Engineer on January 1, 2022, with an annual salary of $185,000 plus benefits.

6. Throughout his employment, Plaintiff consistently received "Exceeds Expectations" ratings on his annual performance reviews. His 2023 performance review, dated February 15, 2024, stated: "Robert continues to be one of our top performers. His technical leadership on the Phoenix Project saved the company an estimated $2.3 million in development costs."

7. On April 1, 2024, Plaintiff received a merit increase of 8%, bringing his annual salary to $199,800, along with a performance bonus of $35,000.

Employment Agreement

8. Upon his promotion to Senior Software Engineer, Plaintiff entered into an Employment Agreement dated January 1, 2022 (the "Agreement"). A true and correct copy of the Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

9. Section 4.2 of the Agreement provides that Plaintiff's employment may only be terminated "for Cause," which is defined as: "(a) conviction of a felony; (b) willful misconduct causing material harm to the Company; (c) material breach of this Agreement; or (d) continued failure to perform duties after written notice and 30-day cure period."

10. Section 4.3 of the Agreement provides that in the event of termination without Cause, Plaintiff shall be entitled to: "(a) twelve months of base salary continuation; (b) continuation of health benefits for twelve months; (c) accelerated vesting of all equity awards; and (d) a pro-rata bonus for the year of termination."

Safety Violations and Whistleblowing

11. In May 2024, Plaintiff was assigned to lead the development of TechCorp's new cloud infrastructure project, codenamed "Project Titan."

12. During his work on Project Titan, Plaintiff discovered serious security vulnerabilities in TechCorp's customer data handling procedures. Specifically, Plaintiff discovered that:

    a. Customer financial data was being stored in unencrypted databases in violation of PCI-DSS compliance requirements;

    b. Access controls to sensitive customer information were inadequate, with over 200 employees having unnecessary access to customer Social Security numbers and financial data;

    c. Data backup procedures failed to meet industry standards, creating risk of catastrophic data loss; and

    d. The company had failed to implement required security patches for over 18 months, leaving systems vulnerable to known exploits.

13. On June 15, 2024, Plaintiff reported these security concerns in writing to his direct supervisor, Jennifer Martinez, Vice President of Engineering. A true and correct copy of Plaintiff's written report is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

14. On June 22, 2024, Plaintiff attended a meeting with Ms. Martinez and Chief Technology Officer David Chen. During this meeting, Plaintiff was instructed to "stop making waves" and told that addressing the security issues would be "too expensive" and would "delay the product launch."

15. On July 8, 2024, Plaintiff escalated his concerns to TechCorp's General Counsel, Sarah Williams, via email. Plaintiff's email detailed the specific violations and expressed concern that the company's failure to address these issues could result in regulatory penalties and harm to customers.

16. On July 10, 2024, Ms. Williams responded that the matter would be "reviewed by appropriate personnel" but provided no timeline or specific commitments.

17. On July 25, 2024, having received no substantive response, Plaintiff filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office regarding TechCorp's data security practices. A true and correct copy of this complaint is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

Retaliatory Termination

18. On August 28, 2024, less than five weeks after Plaintiff filed his complaint with the Attorney General, Plaintiff was called into a meeting with Ms. Martinez and Human Resources Director Thomas Brown.

19. At this meeting, Plaintiff was informed that his employment was being terminated, effective immediately. When Plaintiff asked for the reason for his termination, he was told only that it was a "business decision" and that the company was "going in a different direction."

20. Plaintiff was not provided with any written documentation of performance issues, was not given any prior warning, and was not afforded any opportunity to cure any alleged deficiencies.

21. Defendant's stated reason for Plaintiff's termination is pretextual. The true reason for Plaintiff's termination was his protected whistleblowing activity.

22. The temporal proximity between Plaintiff's protected activity and his termination—less than five weeks—demonstrates retaliatory intent.

23. At the time of his termination, Plaintiff was not provided with any of the severance benefits required under Section 4.3 of the Agreement for termination without Cause.

Damages

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's wrongful conduct, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer damages including:

    a. Lost wages and benefits in excess of $250,000;
    b. Lost equity compensation valued at approximately $125,000;
    c. Damage to professional reputation;
