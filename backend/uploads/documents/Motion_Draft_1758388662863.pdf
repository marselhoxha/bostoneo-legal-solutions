T* (counsel, and hereby respectfully moves this Honorable Court to suppress evidence) Tj
T* (obtained in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States) Tj
T* (Constitution and Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and in support) Tj
T* (thereof states as follows:) Tj
T* () Tj

T* () Tj
T* (1. The Defendant, JOHN MICHAEL SMITH, stands charged in the above-captioned matter.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (2. This Motion is filed pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 13 and is timely filed.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (3. The evidence sought to be suppressed was obtained during an unlawful search) Tj
T* (conducted on January 15, 2024.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (**II. STATEMENT OF FACTS**) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (4. On January 15, 2024, at approximately 3:30 p.m., Defendant was operating his motor) Tj
T* (vehicle in Worcester, Massachusetts.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (5. Officer Johnson of the Worcester Police Department initiated a traffic stop of) Tj
T* (Defendant's vehicle, allegedly for running a red light at the intersection of Main Street and) Tj
T* (Park Avenue.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (6. Upon information and belief, video surveillance evidence demonstrates that the traffic) Tj
T* (light was yellow when Defendant entered the intersection, making the initial stop pretextual) Tj
T* (and without reasonable suspicion of any traffic violation.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (7. During the course of the traffic stop, Officer Johnson conducted a search of Defendant's) Tj
T* (vehicle without obtaining Defendant's consent, without a valid search warrant, and without) Tj
T* (probable cause to believe that evidence of criminal activity would be found therein.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (8. No exigent circumstances existed that would have justified the warrantless search of) Tj
T* (Defendant's vehicle.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (9. The search was conducted absent any reasonable belief that Defendant posed a threat) Tj
T* (to officer safety or that evidence would be destroyed.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (10. As a result of this unlawful search, Officer Johnson allegedly discovered evidence that) Tj
T* (the Commonwealth now seeks to introduce against Defendant.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (**III. LEGAL ARGUMENT**) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (**A. The Traffic Stop Violated the Fourth Amendment and Article 14**) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (11. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects "[t]he right of the) Tj
T* (people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable) Tj
T* (searches and seizures." U.S. Const. amend. IV.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (12. Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides even greater protection,) Tj
T* (stating that "[e]very subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and) Tj
T* (seizures, of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions." Mass. Const. pt.) Tj
T* (1, art. XIV.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (13. A police officer may conduct a traffic stop only where the officer has "reasonable) Tj
T* (suspicion that the motorist has committed a traffic violation or some other criminal offense.") Tj
T* (*Commonwealth v. Fernandez*, 398 Mass. 658, 661 \(1986\).) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (14. Here, the available video evidence demonstrates that Defendant lawfully entered the) Tj
T* (intersection on a yellow light, thereby negating any reasonable suspicion of a traffic) Tj
T* (violation.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (15. Absent reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or a traffic violation, the initial stop of) Tj
T* (Defendant's vehicle was unlawful and violated both the Fourth Amendment and Article 14.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (**B. The Vehicle Search Violated the Fourth Amendment and Article 14**) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (16. Even assuming *arguendo* that the traffic stop was lawful, the subsequent search of) Tj
T* (Defendant's vehicle was conducted in violation of his constitutional rights.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (17. Under *Pennsylvania v. Labron*, 518 U.S. 938 \(1996\), and *Commonwealth v.) Tj
T* (Almeida*, 373 Mass. 266 \(1977\), law enforcement officers may conduct a warrantless) Tj
T* (search of a motor vehicle only upon probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains) Tj
T* (evidence of criminal activity.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (18. The "search incident to arrest" exception recognized in *Arizona v. Gant*, 556 U.S. 332) Tj
T* (\(2009\), and *Commonwealth v. Daniel*, 464 Mass. 746 \(2013\), permits vehicle searches) Tj
T* (only when: \(a\) the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at) Tj
T* (the time of search, or \(b\) it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the) Tj
T* (offense of arrest.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (19. Here, no arrest had been effectuated at the time of the search, and Officer Johnson) Tj
T* (lacked probable cause to believe that Defendant's vehicle contained evidence of criminal) Tj
T* (activity.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (20. No exigent circumstances existed that would justify the warrantless search under) Tj
T* (*Commonwealth v. A Juvenile*, 368 Mass. 580 \(1975\).) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (21. Defendant did not provide consent to search his vehicle, nor did he waive his) Tj
T* (constitutional rights. *Commonwealth v. Claiborne*, 298 Mass. 86 \(1987\).) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (**C. The Exclusionary Rule Requires Suppression**) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (22. Evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and Article 14 must be) Tj
T* (excluded from trial under the exclusionary rule. *Mapp v. Ohio*, 367 U.S. 643 \(1961\);) Tj
T* (*Commonwealth v. Upton*, 394 Mass. 363 \(1985\).) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (23. Massachusetts courts apply the exclusionary rule to suppress evidence obtained) Tj
T* (through constitutional violations. *Commonwealth v. Amendola*, 406 Mass. 592 \(1990\).) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (24. Under the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine, any derivative evidence obtained as a) Tj
T* (result of the unlawful search must also be suppressed. *Wong Sun v. United States*, 371) Tj
T* (U.S. 471 \(1963\); *Commonwealth v. White*, 374 Mass. 132 \(1977\).) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (25. Any statements made by Defendant following the illegal search were tainted by the) Tj
T* (constitutional violation and must be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.) Tj
T* (*Commonwealth v. Martin*, 369 Mass. 640 \(1976\).) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (**IV. REQUESTED RELIEF**) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (A. Grant this Motion to Suppress Evidence;) Tj

T* (unlawful search;) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (D. Suppress any derivative evidence obtained as a result of the aforementioned) Tj
T* (constitutional violations;) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (E. Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (**REQUEST FOR EVIDENTIARY HEARING**) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (Defendant respectfully requests that this Honorable Court conduct an evidentiary hearing) Tj
T* (on this Motion, at which time Defendant will present testimony and evidence in support of) Tj
